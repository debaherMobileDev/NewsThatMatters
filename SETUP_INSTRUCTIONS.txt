You can run the app right away without an API key.

STEPS:
1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Select a simulator (iPhone 14 or later recommended)
3. Press Cmd+R to build and run
4. The app will use sample news articles for testing

⚠️ NOTE: Mock data shows 6 sample articles. To get real news:

OPTIONAL - ADD REAL NEWS API:
-----------------------------

1. GET A FREE NEWS API KEY:
   - Visit: https://newsapi.org/register
   - Sign up for a free account (Developer plan)
   - Copy your API key

2. ADD API KEY TO THE APP:
   - Open: News That Matters/Services/NetworkService.swift
   - Find line 16: private let apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
